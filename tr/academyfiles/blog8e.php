<p class="mt-4">In aquaculture facilities, tanks and equipment are constantly exposed to water, salt, and disinfectants. Over time, traditional materials such as metal and fiberglass become vulnerable to corrosion and degradation. Plastic tanks, especially those manufactured from polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), offer unmatched corrosion resistance—making them ideal for long-term, low-maintenance aquaculture infrastructure.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. Corrosion Mechanisms in Traditional Materials</h2>
<p>Metals like stainless steel corrode when exposed to chlorine, oxygen, and saline environments. This can lead to flaking, rust, and eventually structural failure. Fiberglass (GRP) may resist corrosion initially but can degrade under UV exposure and strong chemicals, leading to delamination and microcracks.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. How Plastics Prevent Corrosion</h2>
<p>PE and PP are chemically inert. They do not react with salts, acids, or alkaline compounds used in fish farming. Their non-porous structure prevents water ingress and bacterial buildup. Additionally, they can handle high humidity environments without losing strength or integrity.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In aquaculture, corrosion can lead to system failure and increased costs. Plastic tanks eliminate this risk, offering peace of mind, lower maintenance needs, and a long service life even in aggressive environments. For farms focused on operational continuity and hygiene, corrosion-resistant plastic tanks are a strategic investment.</p>
