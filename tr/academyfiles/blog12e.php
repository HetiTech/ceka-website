<p class="mt-4">In aquaculture, maintaining clean tank surfaces is essential to prevent disease outbreaks and ensure optimal fish health. Biofilm formation—a buildup of microbial communities on surfaces—can compromise water quality and increase pathogen risks. Plastic tanks, especially those made from polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), offer hygienic advantages that significantly reduce biofilm accumulation compared to metal or fiberglass alternatives.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. Non-Porous Surfaces and Easy Cleaning</h2>
<p>PE and PP tanks have naturally smooth, non-porous surfaces that do not trap organic matter or moisture. This prevents microbial adhesion and simplifies routine cleaning procedures. In contrast, materials like fiberglass or rough-coated metal can develop microcracks where biofilms thrive.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Chemical Resistance and Disinfection</h2>
<p>Plastic tanks can withstand a wide range of cleaning agents and disinfectants, including chlorine-based compounds and peracetic acid. This makes it possible to sanitize tanks thoroughly without damaging the structure or compromising material safety.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Choosing plastic tanks in aquaculture not only offers structural and economic benefits but also supports better hygiene. Their smooth surface, ease of cleaning, and resistance to harsh disinfectants make PE and PP tanks an ideal option for biosecure fish farming environments where health and cleanliness are top priorities.</p>
