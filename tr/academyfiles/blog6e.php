  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Why the Fisheries Industry Prefers Plastic Over Steel and Polyester</p>

  <p class="mt-4">In industrial aquaculture and fish farming, the materials used for tanks and equipment directly impact efficiency, safety, and long-term operational costs. Traditionally, <strong>steel and polyester</strong> have been dominant in the construction of water tanks, piping, and filtration systems. However, recent advancements and field experience have led many professionals to shift toward <strong>plastic-based solutions</strong>, particularly polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE).</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. Corrosion Resistance</h2>
  <p>Unlike metal structures such as stainless or galvanized steel, plastics are inherently resistant to corrosion caused by saltwater, chemicals, or biofouling. This property is especially critical in fish farms near coastal or brackish water environments.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Seamless Fabrication & Flexibility</h2>
  <p>Polyethylene and polypropylene tanks are manufactured through butt-welding, extrusion welding, and roto-molding techniques. This allows for seamless designs, custom geometries, and adaptability in tight plant layouts — features much harder to achieve with steel or polyester tanks.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">3. Maintenance-Free Operation</h2>
  <p>Plastics do not require internal or external painting, coating, or anti-corrosion treatments. They are non-toxic, low maintenance, and ideal for hygienic aquaculture operations where chemical residues and rust must be avoided.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">4. Longevity & Cost-Effectiveness</h2>
  <p>Plastic tanks and pipe systems offer exceptional life expectancy. While initial costs can be slightly higher than some polyester alternatives, the absence of recurring repair costs, downtime, and surface treatment make them more economical in the long run.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">5. Environmental Considerations</h2>
  <p>Modern plastic production methods are energy-efficient and recyclable. The lower weight of plastic structures also means reduced transportation and installation emissions compared to heavy steel tanks.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>With their outstanding durability, hygiene, and customization potential, plastics like PP and PE have become the smart material choice for modern aquaculture. As sustainability and operational efficiency take center stage in the industry, plastic continues to prove its value over legacy materials.</p>
