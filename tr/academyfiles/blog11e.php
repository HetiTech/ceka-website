<p class="mt-4">In modern aquaculture, sustainability has become a key decision factor when selecting materials. Plastic tanks made from PE and PP not only perform reliably but also align with long-term environmental goals. Their recyclable nature, low carbon footprint during manufacturing, and resistance to degradation make them a sustainable choice for responsible fish farming.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. Recyclability and Reusability</h2>
<p>PE and PP are among the most recycled plastics globally. At the end of their lifecycle, tanks made from these materials can be shredded, reprocessed, and reused in non-structural applications such as piping or secondary tank products—contributing to a circular economy.</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Energy Efficiency and Carbon Emissions</h2>
<p>Plastic tank production requires less energy compared to steel or fiberglass, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, their lighter weight lowers transportation energy costs, especially in large-scale deployments.</p>
